.SH NAME
\fBrelease \fP- decrement number of references on an rc object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
void \fBrelease\fP(void* \fIptr\fP);
.fam T

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIptr\fP is the pointer of the object returned by \fBrc_alloc\fP(3)
.SH NOTES
release should be called in place of \fBfree\fP(3). If you never call \fBretain\fP(3),
you should be able to use release much like you'd use \fBfree\fP(3), but for every
time you \fBretain\fP(3) an object, you must call release on it, plus one
additional time to reach 0 (since the count starts at 1 when allocated by
\fBrc_alloc\fP(3)).
.SH MACROS
You may use \fBDONE\fP(\fIptr\fP) in place of release.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBrc_alloc\fP(3), \fBretain\fP(3), \fBset_destructor\fP(3), \fBset_finalizer\fP(3)
